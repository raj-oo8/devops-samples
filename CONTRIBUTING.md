# Contributing to Project Name

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this repository. It's people like you that make Project Name such a great tool.

## Where to start?

### Bug reports

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful.

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — try to reproduce it using the latest `main` branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** — ideally create a reduced test case.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

### Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Adhere to the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), which is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly.

Thank you! ❤️❤️❤️
